/**
 * Instances of this class are responsible for managing the
 * connection between SWT and the underlying operating
 * system. Their most important function is to implement
 * the SWT event loop in terms of the platform event model.
 * They also provide various methods for accessing information
 * about the operating system, and have overall control over
 * the operating system resources which SWT allocates.
 * <p>
 * Applications which are built with SWT will <em>almost always</em>
 * require only a single display. In particular, some platforms
 * which SWT supports will not allow more than one <em>active</em>
 * display. In other words, some platforms do not support
 * creating a new display if one already exists that has not been
 * sent the <code>dispose()</code> message.
 * <p>
 * In SWT, the thread which creates a <code>Display</code>
 * instance is distinguished as the <em>user-interface thread</em>
 * for that display.
 * </p>
 * The user-interface thread for a particular display has the
 * following special attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The event loop for that display must be run from the thread.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Some SWT API methods (notably, most of the public methods in
 * <code>Widget</code> and its subclasses), may only be called
 * from the thread. (To support multi-threaded user-interface
 * applications, class <code>Display</code> provides inter-thread
 * communication methods which allow threads other than the
 * user-interface thread to request that it perform operations
 * on their behalf.)
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The thread is not allowed to construct other
 * <code>Display</code>s until that display has been disposed.
 * (Note that, this is in addition to the restriction mentioned
 * above concerning platform support for multiple displays. Thus,
 * the only way to have multiple simultaneously active displays,
 * even on platforms which support it, is to have multiple threads.)
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Enforcing these attributes allows SWT to be implemented directly
 * on the underlying operating system's event model. This has
 * numerous benefits including smaller footprint, better use of
 * resources, safer memory management, clearer program logic,
 * better performance, and fewer overall operating system threads
 * required. The down side however, is that care must be taken
 * (only) when constructing multi-threaded applications to use the
 * inter-thread communication mechanisms which this class provides
 * when required.
 * </p><p>
 * All SWT API methods which may only be called from the user-interface
 * thread are distinguished in their documentation by indicating that
 * they throw the "<code>ERROR_THREAD_INVALID_ACCESS</code>"
 * SWT exception.
