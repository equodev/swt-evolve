/**
 * Instances of this class are controls that allow the user
 * to choose an item from a list of items, or optionally
 * enter a new value by typing it into an editable text
 * field. Often, <code>Combo</code>s are used in the same place
 * where a single selection <code>List</code> widget could
 * be used but space is limited. A <code>Combo</code> takes
 * less space than a <code>List</code> widget and shows
 * similar information.
 * <p>
 * Note: Since <code>Combo</code>s can contain both a list
 * and an editable text field, it is possible to confuse methods
 * which access one versus the other (compare for example,
 * <code>clearSelection()</code> and <code>deselectAll()</code>).
 * The API documentation is careful to indicate either "the
 * receiver's list" or the "the receiver's text field" to
 * distinguish between the two cases.
 * </p><p>
 * Note that although this class is a subclass of <code>Composite</code>,
 * it does not make sense to add children to it, or set a layout on it.
