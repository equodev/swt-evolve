 * limitations in advance of when those limitations can be addressed
 * by the team.  Any class built using subclassing to access the internals
 * of this class will likely fail to compile or run between releases and
 * may be strongly platform specific. Subclassing should not be attempted
 * without an intimate and detailed understanding of the workings of the
 * hierarchy. No support is provided for user-written classes which are
