/**
 * The CCombo class represents a selectable user interface object
 * that combines a text field and a list and issues notification
 * when an item is selected from the list.
 * <p>
 * CCombo was written to work around certain limitations in the native
 * combo box. Specifically, on win32, the height of a CCombo can be set;
 * attempts to set the height of a Combo are ignored. CCombo can be used
 * anywhere that having the increased flexibility is more important than
 * getting native L&amp;F, but the decision should not be taken lightly.
 * There is no strict requirement that CCombo look or behave the same as
 * the native combo box.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that although this class is a subclass of <code>Composite</code>,
 * it does not make sense to add children to it, or set a layout on it.
